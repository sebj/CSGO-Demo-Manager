#CSGO Demo Manager
**A demo manager for [Counter-Strike: Global Offensive](http://store.steampowered.com/app/730/) on OS X.**

There seems to be [a demo manager for Windows](http://csgo-demos-manager.com) (and maybe others), but none for OS X, so I took it upon myself to try and make one. It's not perfect ([create an issue](https://github.com/sebj/CSGO-Demo-Manager/issues/new) if you find a bug or have a problem), but seems to work alright in my testing.

**Features:**
* See a list of demos given a folder
* See details for each demo – map name, server name & IP, and type (GOTV or POV)
* Search by map or file name
* Share as compressed .zip through standard OS X share menu
* Quickly watch a demo back in CS:GO
* Format filenames neatly – options to replace certain characters, and capitalize words
* Supports Dark Mode on Yosemite
